# A tic tac toe program in scala

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to:
- manually rewrite haskell code as scala code
- create a small scala project
- divide the program in three parts: api, lib and cli
- make api and lib reusable as a component behind a rest 

## Details

I'm less interested in the program logic, rather in the devops aspect of the project.
The program is taken from *Hutton (2016): Programming in Haskell, 2nd ed.*, ch. 11.
As haskell is one of the influences of scala, I'll try to make an ideomatic port of the code.

I want to use the tic tac toe "engine" behind a rest service interface in another project.
